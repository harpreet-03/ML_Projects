Welcome to the Energy Efficiency Prediction project! In this repository, we explore the fascinating realm of energy analysis using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to predict heating and cooling loads for various building shapes by analyzing their structural and design characteristics.

## Dataset Overview

### Dataset Information

We utilize a comprehensive dataset that simulates 12 different building shapes using Ecotect software. These simulations encompass diverse parameters such as glazing area, orientation, and more, resulting in 768 unique building configurations. Each sample in the dataset consists of 8 features and 2 real-valued responses.

### Attribute Information

The dataset features eight attributes, denoted as X1 through X8, representing different aspects of building design. The two responses, denoted as y1 and y2, represent heating and cooling loads, respectively. 

- **X1:** Relative Compactness
- **X2:** Surface Area
- **X3:** Wall Area
- **X4:** Roof Area
- **X5:** Overall Height
- **X6:** Orientation
- **X7:** Glazing Area
- **X8:** Glazing Area Distribution
- **y1:** Heating Load
- **y2:** Cooling Load
